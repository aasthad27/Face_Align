# Real-Time Face Detection and Alignment using MTCNN
![mp3](https://github.com/aasthad27/Face_Align/assets/89932857/e3a18e58-6baa-415f-a08f-e0e686b3c94b)

This project demonstrates real-time face detection and alignment using the Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) model and OpenCV. It captures video from the default camera and detects faces in each frame, drawing bounding boxes and facial landmarks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MTCNN

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mtcnn
